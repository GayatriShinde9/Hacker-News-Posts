Hacker News Posts – Data Analysis Project
## Project Overview
## This project analyzes posts from Hacker News to identify patterns and insights related to:
### •	Post types (Ask HN, Show HN, etc.)
### •	User engagement (comments)
### •	Posting time trends
### •	Best time to post for maximum comments
### The analysis is performed using Python in a Jupyter Notebook environment.

## Objective
## The main objectives of this project are:
### 1.Compare Ask HN and Show HN posts.
### 2.Determine which type receives more comments on average.
### 3.Identify the best hour of the day to post Ask HN for maximum engagement.
### 4.Perform data cleaning and preprocessing.
### 5.Generate meaningful insights from the dataset.

## Technologies Used
### •	Python
### •	Jupyter Notebook
### •	Pandas – Data manipulation
### •	Datetime – Time conversion and analysis
### •	Matplotlib / Seaborn (if used) – Data visualization

## Dataset Description
## The dataset contains Hacker News posts with the following columns:
### •	id – Unique post ID
### •	title – Post title
### •	url – Post URL
### •	num_points – Points received
### •	num_comments – Number of comments
### •	author – Post author
### •	created_at – Date and time of post creation

## Project Workflow
## 1️.Data Loading
### •	Read the CSV file.
### •	Convert dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.

## 2️.Data Cleaning
### •	Remove header row if duplicated.
### •	Convert numeric columns to proper data types.
### •	Handle missing values (if any).

## 3️.Filtering Data
### •Separate:
### o	Ask HN posts
### o	Show HN posts
### o	Other posts

## 4️.Analysis
### •	Calculate:
### o	Total number of Ask HN posts
### o	Total number of Show HN posts
### o	Average comments for each category

## 5️.Time-Based Analysis
### •	Extract hour from created_at
### •	Calculate average comments by hour
### •	Sort hours to find best time to post

## Key Insights
### •	Ask HN posts generally receive more comments than Show HN posts.
### •	Certain hours of the day generate higher engagement.
### •	Posting during peak engagement hours increases visibility and discussion.

## How to Run the Project
### 1.Install required libraries:
### pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
### 2.Open Jupyter Notebook:
### jupyter notebook
### 3.Open the file:
### Exploring Hackers News Posts_python.ipynb
### 4.Run all cells sequentially.

## Example Output
### •	Average comments for Ask HN
### •	Average comments for Show HN
### •	Sorted list of best posting hours
### •	Visual representation of engagement trends (if plotted)

## Future Improvements
### •	Add more visualizations (bar charts, line plots)
### •	Analyze points vs comments relationship
### •	Perform sentiment analysis on post titles
### •	Build a dashboard using Power BI or Streamlit
